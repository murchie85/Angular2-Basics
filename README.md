## Resources to clone 

There are a lot of resources required to download even for a base project, I have used bare minimum from BuckyRoberts example which can be found [here](https://github.com/buckyroberts/angular-2-template)

## Installing NPM and Node.js

Download the latest version of Node.js if you do not already have it installed on your machine. This download will also include the latest version of npm.

## Run the Project

You can kick off the base project from Bucky's repo simply by running the command below. The program is executed with a TypeScript compiler in watch mode and run lite-server with automatic refreshing.
